# dependument

Dependument is an open-source, lightweight (ironically, it has no dependencies) tool for automatically documenting the dependencies associated with your project.

## Setup
To install dependument, simply run the following command to install the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dependument).

    $ npm install -g dependument

### Why does it need global installation?
Dependument needs to be installed globally (with the `-g` argument) so that you can run it from the command line.

## Usage
To use dependument, first navigate to your project folder with your terminal.
